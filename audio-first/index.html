                <p><b>SASHA-ANN SIMONS, HOST:</b> This is Reset, I'm Sasha-Ann Simon. A new Chicago Sun Times WBEZ poll finds a majority of likely Republican voters in Illinois would support Donald Trump in 2024 if he should run for president again. And even more believed that he should be in office now. This comes as the January 6 hearings continued today. And the focus is on Trump's role in the fatal insurrection with his claims of election fraud. What's become known as "The Big Lie." Joining us now with more from the poll is WBEZ state politics reporter, David McKinney. So take us back to the 2020 presidential election. What were the results here in Illinois?</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>DAVE MCKINNEY:</b> Well, Illinois was not one of those states that factored into the big lie. As you mentioned, it was an election that was called basically an hour after the polls closed and Donald Trump got killed here. I mean, he wound up losing to Joe Biden about I think, was 58 to 41%. So 17 percentage points, was not even close here.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> And you worked on this new Chicago Sun Times/WBEZ poll to take the pulse of Illinois Republican voters. So what was it that you guys were trying to find?</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> Well, I mean, we have a primary coming up on June 28. And you know, that the gubernatorial field is really kind of where most of the oxygen is at, and a six way race there among those people. And what's so interesting about it is that Richard Ervin has had this, you know, enormous sum of money thrown at him by Ken Griffin, the Chicago hedge fund billionaire, and we wanted to basically test the waters to see kind of what was the state of that race? And, and, you know, what we found out was pretty surprising.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> So when the survey was conducted, how many people would you say participated altogether?</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> Well, I mean, the group that did this is out of North Carolina called Public Policy Polling, and they they surveyed, using landlines and text messages about 700, a little under 700 people across the state of Illinois, last Monday and Tuesday, and this firm Public Policy Polling, I mean, they they have a bit of a Democratic leaning to them. But at the same time, if you go to the website, 538. There, they're ranked amongst some of the best polling firms in the country. They're graded about an A-. I think the number I saw on them was, you know, they call about 80% of the races accurately. So they're a good pollster.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> So we're curious about these surprise findings Dave. What was the main takeaway?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> Well, as you said, in the intro here, I mean, it seems like the Illinois Republican primary voter in general, is still very enamored with Donald Trump. I mean, you know, we've been watching this morning and last week, these hearings that the January 6 committee has been having. And while the poll was taken ahead of that, the allegations we've known for a while, but they haven't had any kind of bearing or impact on primary voters here. And what we found was that, you know, more than two thirds of the state's GOP voters thought that Trump actually won the election in 2020. So think about that. This information surrounding that false narrative that Trump has put out about the election, has actually sunk in with a large percentage of voters here in Illinois. On the Republican side. 18% thought that Joe Biden actually one another 15%, were unsure. So I mean, again, more proof of that. And nearly 9 out of 10 people still like the, you know, the combative, former president and they want him to run two thirds want him to run again in 2024?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> Dave, where exactly are these people? Like where in Illinois is this support coming from?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> Well, I mean, it's, it's, you know, of course, downstate, which, historically, is a much brighter red color, more Republicans density down there than what we typically see in Chicago and the collar counties, but it was also in the collar counties too those numbers, both both regions, held among Republican primary voters in both regions, still a high number of support for Donald Trump there. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> Why does it seem to have a hold on Illinois Republican voters?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> Well, I mean, I don't know it's sort of one of those things where a lot of people are getting their news from, you know, certain sources and, you know, what they're hearing maybe on on a network, like Fox News is really kind of percolating, or, you know, there are other places as well, but these, they have bought hook, line and sinker, this pro Trump narrative of a stolen election, and, you know, the sense of aggrievement He, he has, he has sold this to them. And it's almost sort of like he's on The Apprentice again, and able to kind of, you know, put the spell on people the way he did with that television show and high ratings. I mean, it's the same kind of principle. You know,
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> You actually spoke with an analyst with the pollster that conducted this survey. I wonder what he made of the findings.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> Well, You know, for those people who have been paying attention to the Trump endorsements, I mean, he's been quite active in different primaries around the country. And, you know, his batting average. It's kind of middling, I would say. I mean, he, he missed in Idaho, he missed in Nebraska, you know, the congressman in North Carolina, Madison Cawthorn, he was for him. And so, you know, even though he's been missing on on some of these endorsements he's making, what the analysts told me from from the pollster was that, you know, the findings that we have here in Illinois, as is true across the country, Donald Trump, you know, can do no wrong. I mean, even if he's swinging and missing, and picking candidates, it's not having any impact on his favorability here.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> I'm just shaking my head. Sorry, Dave. I just couldn't hide it. Do you think the evidence from these hearings happening right now could change their minds about the election results?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> Well, you know, you, you hope people pay attention to what is coming out. But unfortunately, we're kind of in a, as we all know, I mean, we are so polarized in this country. And I think, you know, if people have sort of a baked in a belief system about someone, it's really hard to penetrate that it's almost like trying to chip away at Granite, and that's kind of what my sense is of some of the Republicans we spoke with. In this poll they are committed to Trump come hell or high water.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> If you're just tuning in, this is reset. I'm Sasha and Simon's, and that is WBEZ. state politics reporter, Dave McKinney, we are talking about a new Chicago Sun Times WBEZ poll, which shows likely Republican voters in Illinois still back former President Trump. I want to zoom out just a bit here. Dave Trump Trump's grip on the Republican party that's come under question. Right. Are we seeing a split happening at all among voters and leaders here in Illinois?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> Well, I think, you know, they're still in Illinois, just as is the case across the country. They're still kind of the Never Trump people in Illinois, and then the people who are pro Trump no matter what, and, and that that split, I think was pretty evident in the poll based on, you know, based on what we saw, kind of with the results in the gubernatorial part of this where, you know, Richard Ervin, the Aurora, Aurora mayor, being so far behind Darren Bailey, who is more of a Trump aligned kind of candidate, that that I think, kind of embodies this idea of a rift in the party. And really the problem for mainstream establishment Republicans is that they seem like their influence is gradually waning here. And, we'll have to wait until June 28, to see how this election breaks. But if these numbers hold, it's more proof of that.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> Yeah. You mentioned some data earlier, talk more about how these Illinois Republicans view President Biden?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> Well, I mean, I don't think there's, you know, great surprise, in terms of where they're at on Biden, I mean, you know, overwhelmingly these, you know, they believe that he's responsible for pretty much everything that's going wrong. In America right now, from inflation to everything else. You know, some of the people that we talked to who took this poll, believe that, you know, Biden was not elected legitimately, as we mentioned earlier, and that he's responsible for inflation, and for just everything, as I said, that's going wrong here. So he, he's, he's not high on anybody's list in this poll.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> Those answering the poll also say that the largest group victimized by racism, and by bigotry is white people. Tell us more about that.
                </p>  
                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> Well, I mean, you know, when I first saw that result, I kind of, I had the same sort of shaking my head kind of thing that you just had, like, how is that possible? But what I think it reflects, you know, roughly a third of the respondents in the poll identified whites as the main people suffering from racism and bigotry. And I think where that comes from, is, you know, you've seen this narrative that it's sort of a white grievance ideology that Trump championed when he was in the White House. And we've heard kind of built in woven into the, you know, the platform, I guess, of the GOP nationally about, you know, this critical race theory and replacement theory and those kinds of things where whites are just, you know, to this way of thinking are on the, you know, on the on the way out and so, that that was a shocker to me, because I just don't, it's hard for me to fathom how you know, the white people are in any way discriminated against to the tune that we've seen, you know, other other groups here, it just, you know, but this is the way the Illinois Republican Party every voter or a share of them anyway seems to think. Yeah.
                </p> 
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> Well back to this primary later this month, Trump's mostly stayed out of Illinois. Politics, right, since leaving the White House. How much influence do you think he's going to have on this election?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> You know, such I mean, I think what we're looking for is whether he wades into the gubernatorial primary here and possibly endorses Darren Bailey, the numbers, you know, it almost sort of fits into the Trump playbook where if he sees a candidate that might align with him ideologically on things, if that person is up in the polls that, you know, maybe it's a thing that he would wait into, and then later take credit for the person winning. I think, you know, that's something to look for here between now and June 28. Does Trump put out a statement in support of someone like Darren Bailey or coming to Illinois to do that? He's also gotten involved in a downstate congressional race, and formally endorsed downstate Congresswoman Mary Miller, and she's in a pretty pitched Republican primary battle against Rodney Davis who was also an incoming Republican.
                </p>   
                <br>
                <p><b>SIMONS:</b> That's WBEZ state politics reporter Dave McKinney. Interesting stuff Dave, thank you.

                <br>
                <p><b>MCKINNEY:</b> Yeah, for sure Sasha. Thanks so much.
