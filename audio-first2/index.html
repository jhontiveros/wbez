                <p><b>MARY DIXON, HOST:</b> 18 years ago, Lolita Newell, was arrested by Chicago police officers led by Ronald Watts. Watts was a sergeant sent to federal prison in 2013 for corruption. He was accused of stealing money from drug dealers and framing people who wouldn't pay him protection money. 150 felony convictions tied to Watts and his team have been thrown out, but not Newell's. Her case will be among 28 in Cook County Court today as people ask for exonerations. WBEZ's Chip Mitchell has been reporting on the Watts scandal for years and joins us now. Good morning, Chip. </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>CHIP MITCHELL:</b> Morning, Mary. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>DIXON:</b> Chip, first, can you take us back to the early 2000s and remind us what Watts was accused of?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MITCHELL:</b> He led this police unit that was under investigation for more than a decade. This unit was allegedly framing people and stealing money from drug dealers at a Southside housing complex. Watts and one of his underlings were arrested in 2012 and sent to federal prison for stealing what they thought was drug money from an FBI informant.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>DIXON:</b> Now before the Feds moved on Watts, one of the people whose unit arrested was Lolita Newell. What happened to her?
                <br>
                <p><b>MITCHELL:</b> Back in 2004, she was 23 living with her boyfriend in the housing project. She says they were buying lunch from a woman who sold food out of her apartment when Watts and his unit arrested them on drug charges.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>NEWELL:</b> They jumping out like they in the military, they're just grabbing people, like innocent people.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MITCHELL:</b> She spent more than a year in prison and she says the criminal record has hurt her ever since.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>DIXON:</b> There have been hearings over the last six years, people asking judges to toss out their convictions tied to Watts, and prosecutors have gone along with 150 of these requests. Why?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MITCHELL:</b> Well, one thing, Mary is that prosecutors can no longer put Watts or the other cop who was sent to prison on the witness stand to prove up those cases. And a few years ago, State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office listed 10 other officers who worked under Watts, that it would no longer call to testify. So there just aren't many cops available to testify for these convictions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>DIXON:</b> Today, another 28 cases tied to watts will be in court, what are we expecting to see?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MITCHELL:</b> Prosecutors have said they'll support vacating 19 of these convictions. But that will leave 9 others standing including Lolita Newell's. So the total number of Watts related convictions that Foxx's office will apparently fight to keep on the books, that total will be more than 40.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>DIXON:</b> And why aren't prosecutors agreeing to drop these cases?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MITCHELL:</b> Well, Foxx spoke to reporters after a hearing this month and talked about factors in the decision whether to stand behind a Watts related case, she said it partly has to do with the cops that were involved.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>FOXX:</b> We have to talk about them on the individual basis. It depends on who was working on the cases, the time period that we're looking at the sufficiency of the evidence or other evidence. And so it is being done on a case by case basis.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MITCHELL:</b> So we're expecting to learn a lot more about that at a hearing next month. But the attorneys who are pushing for these convictions to be thrown out insist the cases are all similar to the 150 Watts cases that have already been vacated Mary,
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>DIXON:</b> Where is Newell these days?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MITCHELL:</b> She's 41 now, she says that the felony drug conviction has disqualified her from a lot of government help including the Chicago Housing Authority. So she says she's done a lot of wandering since getting out of prison and has had to rely on friends and relatives to take her in. She's now living in a friend's place in Florida working in a fast food restaurant. And she's thinking of going to school for an associate's degree. She says she's trying to get her life on track and she wants to clear her name.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>DIXON:</b> Chip Mitchell is a reporter on WBEZ's criminal justice desk. Thanks Chip. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MITCHELL:</b> My pleasure Mary.
                </p>
